 Ex.:
 - nmap grep command to simplify results to only PORT STATE SERVICE:
  - `grep -E "^\S+\s+\S+\s+\S+$" DIRECTORY/nmap > DIRECTORY/nmap_cleaned`
  - -E tells grep you're using a regex

Operators:
- regex consist of two parts: constants and operators.
- Constants are sets of strings, operators are symbols that perform operations on the strings.
- Regex operators that represent characters:
- \d matches any digit.
- \w matches any character.
- \s matches any whitespace.
- \S matches any non-whitespace.
- . matches with any single character.
- \ escapes a special character.
- ^ matches the start of the string or line.
- $ matches the end of the string or line.
- \* matches the preceding character zero or more times.
- \+ matches the preceding character one or more times.
- {3} matches the preceding character three times.
- {1, 3} matches the preceding character one to three times.
- {1, } matches the preceding chracter one or more times.
- [abc] matches one of the characters within the brackets.
- [a-z] matches one of the characters within the range of a to z.
- (a|b|c) matches either a or b or c.
- Using this info, we can understand that our regex "^\S+\s+\S+\s+\S+$" means we should extract lines with 3 strings separated by 2 white spaces.
- You can tell because we have 3 S (none-whitespaces = strings) and 2 s (whitespaces).
