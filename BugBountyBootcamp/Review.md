## My 2 cents:

### Who's it for?

- I'd say the book is best for individuals who are just starting in pen testing up to individuals who have practiced pen testing on a lot of machines on services like hackthebox.com and are looking at getting into bug bounties or pursuing education to write exams like the OSCP. For exams like the OSCP, the book will help you in understanding the different ways you can get your initial foothold, but the learning stops there.
  - If you've been following walkthroughs on how to exploit practice machines but you're struggling to figure out how to methodically work through targets to gain an initial foothold, the book should definitely help you to build a methodology.
  - If you're brand new, the book introduces you to a lot of different techniques and concepts that will springboard you into what to learn about next. It really helps solve the "You don't know what you don't know" problem of getting into penetration testing and cyber security from the perspective of bug bounties.

### Pros:

- The book is easily readable and approachable for all levels of technical knowledge.
- There are useful code snippets, scripts, and files that can point you towards what to work on to refine your skills or workflow.
- The "**Finding your First <Chapters focused vulnerability>**" sections really helps drill the routine of finding bugs into the reader, and provides a useful "at a glace" for if you get stuck.
- The book indirectly provides a perspective of how interconnected web app vulnerabilities are. It does this by reiterating techniques that are common to all or multiple web app vulnerabilities.
- Some chapters of the book are full of detailed descriptions, code snippets, examples, and insights that really help you understand the vulnerabilities.

### Cons:

- Some of the chapters are particularly light on detail, examples, and code snippets, and give the impression that the author is not very knowledgeable about the chapters content.
- There are some suggestions in the book that I think are wrong or impossible, like using NetCat as a listener for an SSRF attack where the target server will send requests to your local machine and be captured by NetCat. This is not possible to my knowledge without a significant amount of setup and paid services that are not mentioned.
  - I wouldn't say this is a significant problem with the book, as you would most likely need to research these things in order to carry them out, and that research should correct or inform you of the reality of the suggestion. I did not feel like the book got a lot of things wrong or that it was misleading.

### Should you Buy it?

- If you have an firm grasp on the OWASP top 10, compete or practice on CTFs, and are making decent money as a bug bounty hunter or red teamer, the book is probably a little to basic for you. If you are anywhere under that level of knowledge and skill, it's a resounding YES; You should definitely give this book a read.

### Caution:

- I've added in some of my own ideas or knowledge where I felt it would be useful. I've tried to mention that the information was not found in the book, so take these bits with a grain of salt. I'm by no means an expert, but I do have some knowledge that could be helpful.
  - I may have missed mentioning that the information wasn't found in the book, but probably missed some parts that I took liberty with.
  - Buy the book!
