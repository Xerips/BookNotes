# Hacking APIs: Review

## So Far (as I work through it):

- Less easily readable than the other books here. Could use more headers to break down concepts and clarify the flow of the writing.
  - It feels like it jumps around a bit without much notice as to why. Not a huge deal, but leaves the reader to make small leaps with the information and draw relationships between concepts.
- The author uses "consumer" instead of "user" on and off, and uses "client" to describe the application client but often it seems interchangeable with developers, it also seems to be used to mean user (the actual client of the API service business). They also use "provider" to mean API Gateway, server, or application, and could be more specific so readers understand the terminology the industry uses as well as the actual points of contact being referred to.
  - Would have been nice to have language consistent with the space like: "user" "server" "application" "developer" "API Gateway".
    - This would have helped with readability and clarity.
  - Honestly, the creative use of terminology leads to equivocation and drives me a bit batty.
  - I could be completely wrong about this, and it may in fact be the way in which people in the API space communicate, but it seems inaccurate and sloppy.
- Sections are pretty disorganized and so you will have to reorganize notes and remove duplicate information if you want to have them in a more easily studied or reviewed format. I've done a bit of this to try and organize things, but my notes still jump around quite a bit because the book does.
