# Hacking APIs: Review

## So Far (as I work through it):

- Less easily readable than the other books here. Could use more headers to break down concepts and clarify the flow of the writing.
  - It feels like it jumps around a bit without much notice as to why. Not a huge deal, but leaves the reader to make small leaps with the information and draw relationships between concepts.
