# Hacking APIs: Review

## So Far (as I work through it):

- Less easily readable than the other books here. Could use more headers to break down concepts and clarify the flow of the writing.
  - It feels like it jumps around a bit without much notice as to why. Not a huge deal, but leaves the reader to make small leaps with the information and draw relationships between concepts.
- The author uses "consumer" instead of "user" on and off, and uses "client" to describe the application client but often it seems interchangeable with developers, it also seems to be used to mean user (the actual client of the API service business). They also use "provider" to mean API Gateway, server, or application, and could be more specific so readers understand the terminology the industry uses as well as the actual points of contact being referred to.
  - Would have been nice to have language consistent with the space like: "user" "server" "application" "developer" "API Gateway".
    - This would have helped with readability and clarity.
  - Honestly, the creative use of terminology leads to equivocation and drives me a bit batty.
  - I could be completely wrong about this, and it may in fact be the way in which people in the API space communicate, but it seems inaccurate and sloppy.
- Sections are pretty disorganized and so you will have to reorganize notes and remove duplicate information if you want to have them in a more easily studied or reviewable format. I've done a bit of this to try and organize things, but my notes still jump around quite a bit because the book does.

- Alright, once you get through the first few chapters, the book starts getting really good!
- The fact that the author takes the time to layout some powerful tools that will compensate for using Burp Suite Community is legendary.
- There are some things that haven't aged well, mostly links that no longer work and the configuration for amass has changed, but it's easy enough to look up the information and check out the documentation of features or configurations that have changed since the writing.

## After completing the book:

- This book is absolutely fantastic and gets better and better as you work through it.
- The author is very generous with his knowledge and after completing this book you will have much more than just theory and understanding of different classes of vulnerabilities.
- This book offers real techniques and technology to use in attacks.
- If you're working through this I highly recommend taking note of all the commands used in it so you can recall them when you start working through it.
- I have a little application I wrote called "remember-app" that is located in my CyberSecurity repo. I used this to keep track of the commands for later use.
- Buy this book if you have any desire to hack APIs.
- Buy this book if you want to get real actionable hands on learning of how to hack things.
- Buy this book.
