# Extending BurpSuite

Disclaimer:  
  
This Section of the book works with some outdated tech. To complete this section of the book you will need python2 because jython is designed to work with python2 code. Apprently there is work being done for jython3, but for reference, python3 came out December 2008, so don't hold your breath.  
  
There are also a plethora of tools you can find that have been uploaded by the burp community in BurpSuites BApp Store.  
  
If your main focus is making extensions for BurpSuite, python is not the language to do this in, you'd be better off learning java as that is the native language for Burp.  

I'm going to leave this section alone for now, but it is possible that I return if I find that I could really use some bespoke Burp extensions.  
  
What you'll need:  
* BurpSuite  
* Jython - If you install with pacman, find the readme in /usr/share/doc/jython  
* Java  
* Python2
